# simple-supervisor

My take on Supervisor.


# Motivation

Was looking into a better way to manage running program for work, on Windows.
There's Supervisor for Linux only. It seems like it could be much more simple
and run on Windows. I think I can make my own.


# DIARY

2022-03-13: Have configured and run a simple script to run `git pull` in
            reference repos I care about.

2022-02-02: Popping in here to note that a good use of a thing like this would
            be to regulary go out and `git pull` all the repos I care about.
            Starting a list of things I want `git pull` updated, regularly,
            under the "GIT PULL" above.
