# DIARY

2022-03-13: Have configured and run a simple script to run `git pull` in
            reference repos I care about.
            commit 7e3b89cbb8d93ad5f78f01237aad1925ce7e79d1

2022-02-02: Popping in here to note that a good use of a thing like this would
            be to regulary go out and `git pull` all the repos I care about.
            Starting a list of things I want `git pull` updated, regularly,
            under the "GIT PULL" above.
