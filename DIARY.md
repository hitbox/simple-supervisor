# DIARY

2022-05-07: Loosened restrictions on valid key names for `git pull` commands.
            commit 91df811204db7d51c1f2eef1b16d71c9c3fa06db

            Thinking: CLI command to search for `.git` dirs, report (list) and
            add them to config.

2022-04-04: Have some experience using this thing now. So far, only using the
            simple git pull configuration. It's working well enough to go "Oh,
            that repo I care about! Better add it to this thing. And that
            reminds me--better run simple_supervisor."

            Clarification for the first, 2022-02-02, diary entry: it's a good
            use for this thing so that when I want to look at a repo, and need
            to update it, I don't have to wait for several years to download.

            commit 25bb4b2d103568856ef5288cd91a62f8bf49f932

2022-03-13: Have configured and run a simple script to run `git pull` in
            reference repos I care about.
            commit 7e3b89cbb8d93ad5f78f01237aad1925ce7e79d1

2022-02-02: Popping in here to note that a good use of a thing like this would
            be to regulary go out and `git pull` all the repos I care about.
            Starting a list of things I want `git pull` updated, regularly,
            under the "GIT PULL" above.
